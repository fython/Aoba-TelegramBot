Aoba Bot
======

## Introduce

A Telegram Bot written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language. 
Use [rubenlagus/TelegramBots](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots) as bot base library.
I made a wrapper to develop functions easily and quickly. 
In the future I may separate framework from this repository and publish under Apache 2.0 Licenses.

**Currently only support Chinese. It's inconvenient to support multi-language.**

## What functions it has now?

It's still in unstable development.

Now it has two games you can play in group:

- Guess number
- Deliver bomb (Sticker)

## Configure Bot keystore

- Create `src/main/resources/keystore.properties`
- Add your `BOT_TOKEN` and `BOT_USERNAME` like this:
```properties
BOT_TOKEN=123456:XXXX
BOT_USERNAME=sb_bot
```
